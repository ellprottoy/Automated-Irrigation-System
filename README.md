This is a raspberry pie based automated irrigation system.
I am keeping the code open source for all.
This code applies for raspberry pie of all models.
This code uses a light sensor (TSL2561) to determine if the plants need watering. 
If the light level is below a certain threshold, the irrigation system is turned on.
The current time and light level are printed to the console so you can see the readings.
You will need to modify this code to suit your specific needs and hardware setup. 
 you will need to install the necessary libraries (such as RPi.GPIO and Adafruit_TSL2561) and specify the correct pin number for your Raspberry Pi.
 You may also want to adjust the light threshold and the frequency at which readings are taken.
